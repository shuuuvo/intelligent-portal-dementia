%    Note: Both tex files are already included in the style file. 
%
%% 3. Write each chapter in a separate tex file and name them e.g. Ch1.tex, Ch2.tex, etc. 
% and then use "include" to inlcude them as shown in this example.
% 
%% 4. Citation styles: package "natbib" is used for making references.
%   you should replace the bib file - xbib, with your own bib file
%   at the END of this template file, i.e.   
%   \bibliography{xbib} % use your own bib file 
%   Then, you can use the following two cammands 
%   to cite your reference, pending on how it is use. 
%   (i) Use Command "\citep{...}" to produce the styyle: (Authors, year)
%   (ii) Use Command "\citet{...}" to produce the style: Authers (year)
%
%#### 
% If you wish to produce a list of abbreviations/acronyms 
% that are used in your dissertation, you must read notes 5-8 below. 
%
%% 5. Define abbreviations or acronyms
% 	you can use the given sample file "acronyms.tex" 
% 	to define your abbreviations or acronyms, and 
% 	some examples are already defined in that file.
% 	After you have defined them, (you can add any new items anytime you like), 
% 	save it in the same folder as this "DissertationSample1.tex"
% 	as it is included by using "include{acronyms}" in this file later.
% 	Note: if you use any other file name, change it in "\inlcude{yourFilename}. 
%
%% 6. Using the defined abbreviations/acrynoms
%   In file "acronymNotes.tex", I give some notes and few examples 
%   to explain and show how to use defined acrynoms in your tex file.  
%
%% 7. Generate a List of Abbreviations(LOA)
%  You must issue command "Makeglossaries" to produce few more auxiliary files 
%   e.g. xxxx.acr, and/or .glo, and/or .gls, etc. in order to produce LOA 
%   so, is you use TexStudio, Click "Tools" and choose "Makeglossaries"
%
%% 8. Don't want to have a list of Abbreviations
%  use command "\nolistofabbs", by uncomment it in later part  
%  then LOA will not be generated and not appear in the TOC. 
%  note: you may have to run "Build and View" twice to get the intended result.
%        first run to remove/get the acutal list of abbreviation
%		 second run to remove/get the list appearing on TOC.   
% 
%% 9. Using footnote. (% wjw, added this note on 11/09/2015)
%	If you want to use footnotes in any chapters of your dissertation, 
%	you can use command \footnote{your footnote text} in where you want.
